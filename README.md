##Porpouse 
I'm following The Odin Project course. I've created this directory in order to organize all the material I'm producing while following the lesson and completing the assignments and to show the progress I'm making as a programmer.

##Structure
- Lessons directories: named "lesson-nn-title/" where "nn" is the number of the lesson and "title" is its title. Each directory contains the output of a specific lesson with some notes by me and a README.md with the direct link to the lesson itself. Most of these are practicing stuff, but can give an idea on how I approach assignments and coding in general, I use these to group concepts too;
- Projects directories: named "project-nn-title/" where "nn" is the number of the project and "title" is its title. These are the most important directories, because each contains the link to a structured project on my GitHub created following a specific assignment. These are small or big working projects completely "engineered" and coded by me, starting from a specific requests or problems indicated in the course.
